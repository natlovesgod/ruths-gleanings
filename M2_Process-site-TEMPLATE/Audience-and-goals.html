						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After conducting preliminary research, we determined who our audiences were and the goals applicable to those audiences.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>To better understand and configure the direction of the website redesign, my first step was to begin by narrowing down the intended audience to be targeted specifically. To put this into action, I began by starting broad and gradually moving towards more and more specific groupings.</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/broad-goals.jpg" alt="broad goals" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>The initial step I used in this process was to define the perceived broad goals of my organization, which in turn served to form as a guideline of general direction for proceeding.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/goal-audience-map.jpg" alt="goal audience map" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>Next, I used the broad goals as a jumping point to further narrow the targeted audience into 6 categories: Skeptics, Audience (recipients), Audience (non-involved), Partners, Members, and Donors/Sponsors.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/map-close-up.jpg" alt="map close up" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>After having created the categories, the process continued, with the next step involving the assignment of people, groups, industries, or organizations into the various categories. This aspect was challenging due to many of the audience members being applicable to multiple categories, but the categorization decision ultimately came to be made by placing the various audiences with their assumed “best-fits”.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/category-merge.png" alt="category merge" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>The last step to this part of the process entailed further refinement, which inevitably led to the decision to focus on 3 primary categories to target: Audience (recipients & advocates), Sponsors, and volunteers.</p></div>
					</div>
					<p>Having specified the intended audience for the organization, the next step would come to involve defining applicable goals.</p>
