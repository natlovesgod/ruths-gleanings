						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p>Defining the Design Challenge was the first step. I used the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit as a guide to posing questions to find the root problems of the website for users.
</p>
					</header>
					<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
						<p>The lack of affordable access to healthy foods in Spartanburg.</p>
						<h3>The Design Question:</h3>
						<p>How does Ruth’s Gleanings help provide inexpensive, healthy, and nutritional foods to people who need it in Spartanburg?</p>
						<h3>The Ultimate Impact</h3>
						<p>The aim is to increase donations and support towards the organization, as well as to attract volunteers to serve the cause</p>
						<h3>Possible Solutions</h3>
						<p>Decluttering the organization interface, application of consistent promotion and design, simplifying website text, remove low-resolution adverts and replace them with better quality ones, implement hierarchy</p>
						<h3>Context and Constraints</h3>
						<p>TThe organization is small and highly dependant on donations; lack of funding, recipients outnumber volunteers, information on organization may not reach those who need it most</p>
						<h3>The Design Question Restated</h3>
						<p>“How can I redesign this website to attract more volunteers and resources, as well as reach needful populations?”</p>
