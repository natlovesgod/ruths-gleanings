						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p>Once we had laid a strong foundation with all of our research, our next task was to create a call-to-action button and a style tile.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to Action</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CTA-buttons.png" alt="cta-buttons
							" center=50% /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>The first draft of my call-to-action (CTA) was "Join the Movement," with the implications that the user would join the slow food movement. But that CTA turned out to be as vague as the original Slow Food Upstate website. Where would the user end up? So I decided to switch gears and make my CTA about finding local farmers markets. With this new CTA, the user knows exactly where they will go: to a page listing farmers markets based on location.</p>
							<p>Using a CTA that is more specific not only in intent but also specific to the organization will increase efficiency and user experience.
						</p></div>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u1"><p>A style tile emulates a mood board but is a bit more specific. It includes elements such as type, color, texture, CTA buttons, and images. However a style tile is not a website mockup. These options are all possibilities and not set in stone. A style tile helps with style direction.</p></div>
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/StyleTile.png" alt="Style Tile" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>My style tile communicates a feeling of organic, farm-grown produce; community; and educational opportunities. I chose warm-tinted imagery to convey not only the warmth of the sun over a plowed field, but also the warmth of possibility and goodness. The four adjectives that I chose come from what Slow Food Upstate stands for and promotes.</p>
							<p>The colors I drew from nature: blue for the sky, green for the grass/earth, and yellow for the sun. The yellow CTA button will be used solely for the homepage CTA, "Find a Farmers Market." The green is an accent color and the blue is the main color. But the green and blue could be used interchangably.
						</p><p>
							 I chose the tagline "Good. Clean. Fair." from the Slow Food Upstate mission statement. I simplified their mission into three words that will grab the user's attention and give them some insight into what the organization stands for. In addition to creating a tagline, I tried my hand at redesiging the Slow Food Upstate logo. The original logo was a cartoon-looking snail on top of the organization's name, but I opted for creating a clean, simple logomark that fit the feel of the style tile.
