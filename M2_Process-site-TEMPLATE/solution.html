						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p>Once we had laid a strong foundation with all of our research, the next task was to create a call-to-action buttons and a style tile.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to Action</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/cta buttons.png" alt="ctabuttons
							" center=50% /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>Initially, 3 CTAs developed from analyzing my user goals and primary audience members, with the options being: Volunteer, Donate, and Subscribe. However, after gathering and listening to opinions from secondary parties, a partial re-evaluation occurred, due to the vague nature of the 3rd CTA option: subscribe. At first thought, I believed “subscribe” could function as an umbrella term for people wanting to either become recipients, receive information, or sign up for notifications, but when the term faced secondary parties, they all assumed that it only referred to either joining the organization’s email list or following their blog. Instead, I choose to replace that CTA with “Learn More” to better convey the intended purpose of allowing users to access information with which they could then use to get connected.</p>
							<p>Using a CTA that is more specific not only in intent but also specific to the organization will increase efficiency and user experience.
						</p></div>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u1"><p>A style tile emulates a mood board but is a bit more specific. It includes elements such as type, color, texture, CTA buttons, and images. However a style tile is not a website mockup. These options are all possibilities and not set in stone. A style tile helps with style direction.</p></div>
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/StyleTile.png" alt="Style Tile" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>This style tile works to convey feelings of organic, farm-grown produce, community, and opportunities for education. For the scheme, warm-desaturated imagery was chosen to convey feelings of nature, warmth, and fellowship as well as an overall composition of peace and honesty. The four adjectives chosen represent what Ruth’s Gleanings hopes to convey to its audience through this interface.</p>
							<p>The color choices included were drawn and inspired by nature: including various shades of green for grass, shades of brown for toiled earth, red found in various forms of produce, and yellow sunshine. The main two CTA buttons featured use the selected red and yellow shades to allow them to stand apart and draw the eye as focal points on the site; In terms of importance, they are equal. The third CTA “Learn More” is located to the side and is highlighted with a less visually drawing shade of green, allowing it to serve as a secondary focal point. The Red and Yellow can be used interchangeably for the primary CTAs but dark green will be solely used for the secondary CTA.
						</p><p>
							I chose to include Ruth’s Gleaning's original logo to pay homage to  the site and keep the base recognizable to long term users. Working from the original, I simply took the previous logo and recreated it using only white and solidified the second line font from semi transparent to opaque. With this, I tried my hand at redesigning their logo without fully throwing out their original visual.
